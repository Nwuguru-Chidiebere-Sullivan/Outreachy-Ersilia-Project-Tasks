# Model-eos31ve: Human Liver Microsomal Stability Model

## Overview:
This repository houses all codes and datasets employed in the tasks of validating and reproducing the human liver microsmal model, eso31ve, which is a classification model provided by Ersilia. The model predicts the probability of a compound being unstable in human liver microsomal(HLM) assay, with a half-life of =< 30mins being unstable while > 30mins being stable. 

## Model Information:
- Eos Model ID: eos31ve
- Slug: ncats-hlm
- Task: Classification
- Input: Compound(canonicalsmiles)
- Output: Probability of compound being unstable in HLM assay(float)
- Interpretation: Probability of a compound being unstable in a HLM assay (half-life â‰¤ 30min)

## Steps to Reproduce The Solutions to These Tasks:
### Task 1:
- From the list of models provided in the [Ersilia Book](https://ersilia.gitbook.io/ersilia-book/contributors/internships/outreachy-summer-2024), I selected tthe model of my choice which is [Human Liver Microsomal Stability Model](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos31ve), especially because the model's publication, aim, and methodology resonated with me.
